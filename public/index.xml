      <description>Welcome to Blog!
I have been meaning to write a blog for a while now, but I have been too busy. Finally now that I have some spare time to write about what I think on everything. From complicated things about my research like cybersecurity and blockchain to simple but awesome things like coffee or travel.
Stay tuned for more.</description>
