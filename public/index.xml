      <description>Welcome to Blog!
I have been meaning to write a blog for a while now, but I have been too busy. Finally now that I have some spare time to write about what I think on everything. From complicated things like blockchain to simple but awesome things like coffee or travel.
I will also write about what I learn because that can actually help me remember things and help you the reader (hopefully) to understand and do fun things.</description>

      <description>Mohammed tries to create things out of software and sometimes he breaks things. He fails often but every once in a while, he stumbles onto something. He loves learning new things and when he is not doing that, he can be seen:  Biking around the city. Hiking in the woods or climbing a mountain. Drinking coffee at the nearest starbucks with his macbook.  { Education }  RMIT University</description>
