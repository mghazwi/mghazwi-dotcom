      <description>Mohammed tries to create things out of software and sometimes he breaks things. He fails often but every once in a while, he stumbles onto something. He loves learning new things and when he is not doing that, he can be seen:  Biking around the city. Hiking in the woods or climbing a mountain. Drinking coffee at the nearest starbucks with his macbook.  { Education }  RMIT University</description>
