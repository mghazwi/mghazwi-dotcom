When I started, it all seemed so scary and difficult but the more I looked into it the easier it got. For those who don't know [penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) is the art of finding vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or web applications. Pen testers are among the best in the best in regards to security knowledge and probably the highest paid. During my masters degree, I took a pen testing course and we were instructed to find all vulnerabilities in a given web application and write a report about it. This was one of the most exciting courses I have ever taken. My experience was amazing but I probably gave this course more time that I should have because it made me focus less on other courses I have taken and ofcourse my master thesis. The web application that we were given was in .ova format. You can find it __[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DABXCzsU9wnsXNQtNY7BPnleedAlrx0g)__ if you are interested. I will ommit the full details for now but a summary of the vulnerabilities is below.
