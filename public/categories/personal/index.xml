      <description>Welcome to Blog!
I have been meaning to write a blog for a while now, but I have been too busy. Finally now that I have some spare time to write about what I think on everything. From complicated things like blockchain to simple but awesome things like coffee or travel.
I will also write about what I learn because that can actually help me remember things and help you the reader (hopefully) to understand and do fun things.</description>
